title:
  Chief Technology Officer
location:
  Denver, CO
accomplishments:
  - Hired and trained a development team of 6 employees to improve the product
    and increase overall development velocity.
  - Designed and implemented product enhancements to the application that led to
    over 500k in net new revenue and over 100 new enterprise customers.
  - Migrated applications to Google Cloud in an effort to save on costs,
    gain additional control, and increase overall performance.
  - Identified a performance degradation in which ruby would crash when handling
    the creation of large zip files. We built a solution that leveraged the heavy
    IO capability of go-lang in order to deliver multi-gigabyte zip files while
    incurring minimal resource usage by the process.
